# RPS-LEGEND-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
The Legend of RPS is a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where players compete against a bot to claim the title of "RPS Champ". Featuring a simple menu, fun gameplay, and dynamic score tracking, combined with a touch of drama and humor, to create an engaging user experience.
# HOW IT WORKS
1. Menu System:
The program starts with a main menu offering three options:
Start the Battle: Initiates the Rock-Paper-Scissors game loop.
Rules of the Arena: Displays the game rules.
Score & Title: Shows the current scores and determines the RPS Champ.

2. Gameplay Loop:
The player is asked to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The program generates the RPS-Bot’s move using the random function.
The game compares the player’s choice with the bot’s and determines the winner using conditional logic.

3. Score Tracking:
Both the player’s and the bot’s scores are updated after each round.
A scoring system keeps track of the results throughout the session.

4. Outcome Display:
The program displays round results (win, lose, or draw) with fun and engaging messages.

5. Score & Title Section:
At any time, players can view their scores and check if they’ve dethroned the bot to become the RPS Champ.
